# SUMMARY
This repository is going to house example problems that are found in Paul Zarchan's "Tactical and Strategic Missile Guidance" textbook. These problems are by no means my original work, but a "follow along" wherein I document my learning progress. The source code found in the textbook has been converted from FORTRAN into MATLAB and fully documented by myself. 

## Note:
This literature is publicly available and is by no means a violation of ITAR laws or an effort to circumvent them.
